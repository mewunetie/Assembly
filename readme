What is your mywc program test plan?
mywcBoundary.txt:
For boundary tests, I focused on having tests which contained several new line chars, one line full of only spaces, and a few printable chars in the alphabet in order to see how the programs would handle having only one newline/space/char at a time, as well as a few at a time.
mywcStatement.txt:
For statement tests, I included an essay I wrote for a separate class since it would be able to test all of the lines of mywc.c and mywc.s since it would contain a series of printable chars, new lines, and spaces.
mywcStress.txt:
For the stress test, I wanted to make sure that all possible ASCII printable characters were in this text file so that the programs would be tested on whether they could handle these.
